<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
    Your privacy is important to us. So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose,
    transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and
    let us know if you have any questions.
    <br><br>
    <b>Collection and Use of Personal Information</b><br>
    Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.
    <br><br>
    You may be asked to provide your personal information.
    <br><br>
    Here are some examples of the types of personal information we may collect and how we may use it.
    <br><br>
    <b>What personal information we collect</b><br>
    When you create a Customer ID, we collect your e-mail address, country of residence and a password of your
    choice.
    We also store a preferred currency, who are linked to your country.
    If you choose to buy anything, or if you choose to fill out the personal profile, we collect your full name,
    street address, zip/city and optionally your phone number.
    All credit card and/or payment handling are done by 3rd party companies like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal,
    Vipps.
    We do NOT under any circumstances store ANY payment information that might be linked to you or your account.
    <br><br>
    <b>How we use your personal information</b><br>
    The personal information we collect allows us to ship you your purchased products.
    We will send you our weekly newsletter as long as you have not deselected the newsletter by registration. If you
    don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences on your profile or click
    on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of every newsletter.
    We will NOT under any circumstances let any 3rd party companies access or use your personal information.
    <br><br>
    <b>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</b><br>
    We also collect non-personal information - data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific
    individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are
    some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<br />
    We may collect information such as type of device, location, what is clicked and time spent on a page, so that we
    can better understand customer behaviour and improve our products, services, and advertising. If we do combine
    non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information
    for as long as it remains combined.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cookies and Other Technologies</b><br>
    Our website use “cookies” and other technologies as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better
    understand user behaviour, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the
    effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies
    as non-personal information, and does not link it you your account.
    <br /><br />
    We also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website. This is
    information like your login ID etc.
    <br /><br />
    You may disable cookies for our site in your browser. Please note that certain features, as placing an order, will
    not be possible once cookies are disabled.
    <br /><br />
    As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information
    includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and
    exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
    <br /><br />
    We use this information to understand and analyse trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behaviour on
    the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
    <br /><br />
    In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our website. When customers click
    one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.
    We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of
    our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links
    in the email messages.
    <br /><br />
    Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been
    opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.
    <br><br>
    <b>Disclosure to Third Parties</b><br>
    We do NOT display or give any personal information to 3rd parties, except mandatory information to our 3rd party
    payment partners as VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Vipps upon payment of an order. Your information will NOT be
    shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.
    <br><br>
    <b>Others</b><br>
    It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities
    within or outside your country of residence - for us to disclose your personal information. As our operation is
    placed in Norway, a Court Order from a Norwegian Court will be necessary for us to disclose any personal
    information.
    <br><br>
    <b>Access to Personal Information</b><br>
    You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging
    in to your account and update your profile. We do not store ANY other personal information other than the
    information on your profile page.
    <br><br>
